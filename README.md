# eye-exercise
This is a homework assignment for MIT xPro web-development-javascript. 
In this exercise we create a web page with two eyes 
that follow your mouse movement.
In addition to the eyes, I added eye brows and a mouth so that it looks like a face. I will animate the mouth movement in future improvements.
